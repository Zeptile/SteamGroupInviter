# Steam Group Inviter :: Chrome Extension
There is currently no way to mass invite people to your steam group as Valve removed it from their UI. <br>
This extension re-implements this feature by injecting a script into the Steam Friends page.

## How to use ##
Once extension active & web browser tab navigated to <br>
`https://steamcommunity.com/id/{your_profile_id}/friends/` <br>
You will be able to click on the extension icon to bring up the menu, you simply need to enter the steam community group URL and click on the Send Button.

## Upcoming ##
* Better UX & Styling
* Friends selector feature
